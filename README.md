# Connect-GitHub-Repo-w-AWS

## This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to integrate a GitHub repository with AWS to enable seamless CI/CD workflows and infrastructure deployment.

## Features

* Continuous Deployment: Automatically deploy code changes from GitHub to AWS services.

* CI/CD Pipelines: Use AWS CodePipeline or GitHub Actions for build, test, and deployment.

* Infrastructure as Code: Integrate with AWS CloudFormation or Terraform.

* Access Management: Securely configure IAM roles and permissions for GitHub workflows.


## Setup and Configuration

 Step 1: Set Up AWS IAM for GitHub

* Create an IAM Role:

* Go to the AWS Management Console > IAM.

* Create a role with CodePipeline or required permissions for your project.

* Attach policies such as:

AWSCodePipelineFullAccess

AmazonS3FullAccess

 Custom policies for your use case.

* Generate Access Keys (if using GitHub Actions):

* Go to IAM > Users.

* Select your user and create access keys.

* Store the keys securely (e.g., in GitHub Secrets).

Step 2: Configure Your GitHub Repository

Clone Your Repository:
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo`

* Add GitHub Secrets:

Navigate to your repository on GitHub.

Go to Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions.

Add the following secrets:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

3. Step 3: Set Up CI/CD Pipeline

Option 1: Use GitHub Actions

Create a .github/workflows/deploy.yml file in your repository:
name: Deploy to AWS

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Configure AWS credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
      with:
        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        aws-region: us-east-1

    - name: Deploy application
      run: |
        # Add your deployment commands here, e.g., AWS CLI commands
        aws s3 sync . s3://your-bucket-name

        Commit and push the changes:

        Option 2: Use AWS CodePipeline

1. Create a CodePipeline:

Navigate to AWS CodePipeline in the AWS Management Console.

Create a new pipeline and link it to your GitHub repository.

2. Configure Build and Deploy Steps:

Use AWS CodeBuild to build your application.

Deploy to AWS services such as S3, Lambda, or ECS.

3. Save and Test:

Commit a code change to trigger the pipeline.

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

* GitHub Actions Logs:

View logs under Actions in your repository.

* AWS CloudWatch:

Monitor pipeline and deployment logs in AWS CloudWatch.

Common Issues:

* Ensure correct IAM permissions.

* Verify GitHub secrets are correctly configured.
